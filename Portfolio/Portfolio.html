                Cumulative Reflection
            </strong>
            <p>
                Four years in college sounds a long time, but really goes fast. As time flies, I have learned many
                technical knowledges, and the most importantly, system design. The further I dive into the software
                field, I realize there are important elements in software development. I believe that software
                architecture and maintainability play important roles in the software development. In the four
                years of college experiences, I have taken technical courses from low level as electrical hardware
                up to up level web development. I believe this experience can help me later designing software system
                and have better overview on projects. I have involved in different group project inside and outside of
                class. This will help me solving engineering problem later in my career. It will also help me prepare
                for working in groups. <br>
                Sometime in class, I have taken further steps to successfully complete projects to me. For example,
                I have taken an online course from Stanford to learn about iOS development. This was one of the key
                factors to be successful in a semester long project. There were many times in my learning that I felt
                I need more knowledge beyond classes. This is where I have done personal projects, and interns to
                further expand my technical knowledge. In facts, I felt I have learned more outside of class than in
                class, when I look back in my skill sets. In my senior year, I also involved in research project as
                research assistance. This is really something new to me, because most of the work has very little work
                done in the software community. At the end, I really think the four years of college experience is very
                meaningful to me; and I believe this prepared me in my future careers. <br>

            <strong>
                General Education Reflection
            </strong>
            <p>
                There are many factors for being an engineer, for example technical knowledge, communication skill,
                and teamwork. Often time, students left behind one of the important factors, general knowledge.
                General knowledge could help in many aspects in engineering work. For example, having related knowledge
                can help engineer better understand the client’s needs and concerns. This is an important step in
                design thinking, empathize. General knowledge can be useful in daily work, it could come in handy when
                communicate with different departments.  <br>
                In my four years of colleges of experience, I have decided to take business and other personal finance
                planning courses to extent my general knowledge. I planned to take additional classes to complete
                business minor, because I think general knowledge can be very helpful regardless I will be an employee
                or self-employed. Personal finance planning course can help me making smarter choices with personal
                finance.  <br>
                There were many useful general education classes that are worth to mention. One of the class is
                introduction to management. By understand the management model, it can help me better
                communicate with my co-worker and supervisors. Understand major management challenge can help me better
                prepare to become manager or tech lead later in my career. Another valuable class is personal finance
                planning. The class provides useful content such as retirement planning, and employee benefits.
                I believe this can be very helpful for making personal finance decisions. <br>
                I believe that general education knowledge can be very helpful in my career, and personal life.
                With many general education courses I have taken, I believe that this will be strong help toward
                my career. <br>

            <strong>
                Ethics  Reflection
            </strong>
            <p>
                The definition of Ethics is moral principles that govern a person’s behavior or the conducting of
                an activity. It is important to many different job field, especially in engineering. Because the job that an
                engineer does is that design and build a system that is wildly used by many people. An un‐ethics action
                might have cause terrible incident that would cost a lot of money or people’s life.   <br>
                The purpose of having code of ethics is preventing un‐ethics action accident made by an
                engineer. In many cases, it would be hard for engineer to identify what action would be un‐ethics, and
                code of ethics identify them. When faced with an ethical situation, I would go about following the code
                of ethics, but also taking account of is there any other alternative to solve the problem. Also I will look at
                if the action would be illegal or not in the current country. <br>
                There were a few ethics case discussed within the group. One of them was the article “An
                Amazon Echo may be the key to solving a murder case”. It was about a murder happen inside of a house
                that had equipped with amazon echo. The FBI thinks that amazon echo might have send some voice
                record related to the murder case, so that FBI wanted amazon to release the information. Amazon
                actually refused to release the information to the public or the FBI.   <br>
                I think the 6 virtues that is most related to case is Responsibility. Other virtues isn’t really related
                to the case. What responsibility is accountability, trustworthiness, dependability, reliability, and
                recognizing a personal and moral obligation to act for the good of others. In this case, amazon decided
                not to release its customer private information to the public or FIB. I think that is the responsibility that
                amazon should take on, it should have protected its customer private information.  <br>
